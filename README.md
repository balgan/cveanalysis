# CVE Analysis Dashboard üìä - UPDATED DAILY

## Introduction

This project is dedicated to analyzing and visualizing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data üõ°Ô∏è. It focuses on identifying CVEs by their publication date, and whether they're missing Common Platform Enumerations (CPEs) or references.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Automatically downloads CVE data from the NVD feeds.
- **Data Processing**: Parses the JSON data to identify CVEs with/without CPEs and references.
- **Visualization**: Generates daily and weekly heatmap visualizations to provide insights at a glance.
- **Reporting**: Creates a detailed analysis report of CVE trends over time.

## Heatmaps üî•

The generated heatmaps include:

1. **Total CVEs Per Day**: Shows the total count of new CVEs reported each day.

2. **CVEs Without References**: Indicates the number of CVEs lacking references on a daily basis.

3. **CVEs Without CPEs**: Highlights the daily CVEs that are missing CPEs.

4. **Median and Mean EPSS scores**: Monitor EPSS for changes overtime.
